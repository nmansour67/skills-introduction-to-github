        "\n",
        "This book is for educational and informational purposes only. The content, code, simulations, and AI models (\"Materials\") contained herein are designed exclusively as training exercises to demonstrate the principles of machine learning in healthcare.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Not a Medical Device: The algorithms and \"Digital Twins\" described in this book are educational prototypes. They are not medical devices and have not been approved, cleared, or authorized by the FDA, EMA, or any other regulatory body. They must not be used for diagnosis, treatment, or patient care in any clinical setting.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. No Medical Advice: This book does not constitute medical, legal, or professional advice. The author is not acting as your physician or consultant. Clinical decisions must always be made by qualified healthcare providers based on independent assessment and established institutional protocols.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Use of Code: All code is provided \"AS IS\" without warranty of any kind. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI are stochastic and can produce errors or \"hallucinations.\" Deploying unvalidated code in a healthcare environment poses significant risks. You assume full responsibility for complying with all local laws (HIPAA, GDPR) and institutional regulations before adapting any material for research or use.\n",

        "By accessing, reading, or using any content, code, prompts, case studies, simulations, or materials (collectively, the \"Materials\") in this book, you agree to be bound by the following terms. If you do not agree, do not use this book or its Materials.\n",
        "1. EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY – NOT FOR CLINICAL USE\n",
        "This book is a training manual designed exclusively for educational and skill-building purposes. It teaches health professionals how to explore AI and coding concepts in a controlled, non-clinical environment. The Materials are not intended for, and must not be used in, any clinical, diagnostic, or patient care setting.\n",
        "Not a Medical Device: The code, algorithms, \"Digital Twins,\" Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), and AI models described herein are educational prototypes. They are not medical devices and have not been approved, cleared, or authorized by the FDA, EMA, or any other regulatory body.\n",
        "Simulation Only: All case studies, datasets, and patient scenarios are synthetic, de-identified, or hypothetical. They are provided solely to demonstrate AI principles and coding techniques, not to guide real-world medical decisions.\n",
        "2. NO MEDICAL ADVICE OR CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS\n",
        "The Materials do not constitute medical advice, clinical guidance, or professional healthcare services. The author is not acting as your physician, consultant, or advisor.\n",
        "Do Not Use for Patient Care: You must never use the code, prompts, or outputs from this book to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or condition in a real-world setting.\n",
        "Professional Judgment Required: AI tools described in this book are intended to augment, not replace, professional medical judgment. Clinical decisions must always be made by qualified healthcare providers based on independent assessment and established protocols.\n",
        "3. TECHNICAL AND AI-SPECIFIC DISCLAIMER\n",
        "\"As Is\" Code: All code, prompts, and technical instructions are provided \"AS IS\" and \"AS AVAILABLE\", without warranty of any kind. The author makes no representations regarding their accuracy, reliability, or suitability for any purpose.\n",
        "Volatility of AI Models: This book uses Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI to generate code. These models are stochastic and may produce errors, \"hallucinations,\" or insecure code. The author cannot guarantee consistent or error-free results.\n",
        "Security Warning: The code is for local/cloud testing (e.g., Google Colab) and lacks the security, encryption, and error-handling required for production environments. Deploying this code in live healthcare systems without professional review poses significant risks.\n",
        "4. NO REGULATORY APPROVAL OR VALIDATION\n",
        "The Materials have not been:\n",
